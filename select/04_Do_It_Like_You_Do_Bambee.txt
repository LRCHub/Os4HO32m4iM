Do it like you do

You gotta say it to me
When you wanna do it too
You gotta let me see
The things you wanna do
I wanna get to know
Every side of you
Now is the time to show

I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do

You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe

I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do

You gotta learn to believe
Everything I say
You wanna be with me
Every night and day
Then you should come and stay
And I will take you through
But I gotta say, I wanna do it like you do

I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do

You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe
You gotta learn to believe

I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
I wanna do it like you do
