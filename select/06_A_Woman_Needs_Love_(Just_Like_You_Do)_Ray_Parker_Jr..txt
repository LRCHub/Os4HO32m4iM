Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Mmm-mmm-mmm

A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

Don't the mistake of thinkin' old fashioned [Ooh, ooh]
Times have changed from yesterday
But no longer will those old double standards [Ooh, ooh]
Be accepted by the women of today

So when you think you're foolin' her
She just might be foolin' you
Remember if you can do it
She can too

Because a woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

When her eyes are beggin' for affection [Ooh, ooh]
Don't put her off, don't make her...
