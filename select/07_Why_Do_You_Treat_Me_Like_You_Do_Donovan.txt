Hey, hey, hey, why do you treat me like you do?
Hey, hey, hey, why do you treat me like you do?
There's just as many geese and they're flyin' down south
As there are lies just pouring out of your mouth
Hey, hey, hey, why do you treat me like you do?
You say that you're a young, girl, I guess that's your big excuse
But sometimes I get so low down I wanna shout out, what's the use?
When you've been a lovin' someone else you don't try to hide
You take me for a fool then you take me for a ride
Hey, hey, hey, why do you treat me like you do?
Ah, you seen my face, gal, with the tears all down my mouth
You came up, you held my hand, gal, you don't know what it's all about
I seen you goin' out, there was nothin' I could say
I hung around your house till the very break of day
Then you came a-laughin' down the bright highway
Now, why do you treat me like you do?
My mornings, they're all empty now, my evenings, they're just the same
Now maybe I been thinkin' wrong about you, gal
And you ain't really the one to blame
Keep on lovin' someone else, now don't you try to hide
You can take me for a fool if it keeps you satisfied
'Cause I ain't gonna be the one to ask the reason
Why do you treat me like you do?
