Well I've seen women who cross their legs
Before they sit down to the table
And I've seen women who look to the sky
Screamin', "Lord, I believe in the Bible"

And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square
With their heads held up so high
But I've never seen a woman
Who makes me feel, oh, like you do

Well I've seen couples holdin' hands
With that glazy look in their eyes
And I've seen lovers rollin' round in bed
Screamin' as if they're gonna die

And I've seen lovers holdin' hands
And then laughin' when their back is turned
But I've never seen a woman
Who makes me feel, oh, like you do

Well I've seen women who cross their legs
Before they sit down to the table
And I've seen women who look to the sky
Screamin', "Lord, I believe in the Bible"

And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square
With their heads held up so high
But I've never seen a woman
Who makes me feel, no, I've never seen a woman
Who can make me feel oh like you do

Nobody makes me feel like you do
Listen to me, baby, nobody makes me feel like you do
No, believe me, nobody makes me feel like you do
Oh, oh nobody makes me feel like you do, oh baby, oh baby, baby, baby
I said, nobody, nobody makes me feel like you do, oh

I said nobody, I said nobody, I said nobody makes me feel like you do
Oh I never, never in my life, has anybody ever made me feel
I said never, never, nobody's ever made me feel like you do
Like you do, like you do, like you do
I said nobody makes me feel like you do, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no
